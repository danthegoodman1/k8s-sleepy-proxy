# SleepyPods

SleepyPods is a Rust control plane and proxy system that materializes Kubernetes
workloads on demand. Frontline routes incoming traffic and wakes cold workloads;
a workload-local sidecar proxies application traffic and reports idleness.
Postgres stores durable lifecycle intent so accepted work survives client loss
and controller restart.

The [original validation and independent review](docs/review-evidence/final-integration/README.md)
records measured lifecycle/proxy workloads, recovery guarantees and capacity limits.
[Dynamic certificate delivery](docs/dynamic-certificates-plan.md) uses encrypted
Postgres storage, bounded in-memory proxy caches and change notifications for
rotation and removal. Frontline loads application certificates only from the
control plane. The [certificate validation results](docs/review-evidence/dynamic-certificates/phase6/README.md)
record the deployed behavior, outage limits and measured resource/performance scope.
