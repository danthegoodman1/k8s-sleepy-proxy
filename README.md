# SleepyPods

SleepyPods is a Rust control plane and proxy system that materializes Kubernetes
workloads on demand. Frontline routes incoming traffic and wakes cold workloads;
a workload-local sidecar proxies application traffic and reports idleness.
Postgres stores durable lifecycle intent so accepted work survives client loss
and controller restart.

The [original validation and independent review](docs/review-evidence/final-integration/README.md)
records measured lifecycle/proxy workloads, recovery guarantees and capacity limits.
[Dynamic certificate delivery](docs/dynamic-certificates-plan.md) is being added
with separate deployment, outage, resource and final review gates; the historical
results do not establish those new guarantees.

upgrade requirements.
