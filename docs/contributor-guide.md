# SleepyPods Contributor And Agent Guide

This repo favors the least code that satisfies the current milestone and its
tests. Keep changes small, avoid mega files, and update the development-plan
status when a documented gap actually closes.

## Repo Map

- `crates/control-plane`: API service implementations, durable store trait, Postgres provider,
  route resolver, wake/sleep/delete state machines, manifest rendering,
  Kubernetes materializer, native gRPC, and gRPC-Web operator transport.
- `crates/frontline`: always-on proxy runtime, route cache and matcher, lazy
  Subscribe resolver, wake coordination, HTTP-01 interception, HTTP/TLS/SNI
  listeners, and frontline load-smoke helper.
- `crates/sidecar`: workload-local HTTP/TCP proxy, drain/idle detection,
  `ReportIdle` client, and sidecar load-smoke helper.
- `crates/proxy-core`: shared proxy primitives, TLS ClientHello/SNI parsing,
  accounting, drain, shutdown, timeout, proxy-specific metrics adapters, and hot-path benches.
- `crates/sleepypods-api`: generated protobuf clients/services, shared routing and
  HTTP-01/certificate contracts, state/backend/target values, and native transport
  and client bearer authentication.
- `crates/sleepypods-certificate`: maintained-library certificate/key/chain and
  hostname validation shared by publication and Frontline installation, without
  persistence or sealing dependencies.
- `crates/sleepypods-observability`: metric and tracing vocabulary, the single
  process-wide recorder, sinks, and Prometheus exporter.
- `crates/sleepypods-types`: shared ID/value types.
- `scripts`: production-image smokes, kind E2E gates, soak gates, load-budget
  helpers, and Criterion regression checker.
- `docs`: north-star, development plan, operator docs, runbook, contributor
  guide, and hot-path budgets.

## Generated Files

`crates/sleepypods-api/build.rs` uses vendored `protoc` through
`tonic_prost_build` to compile the protobuf at build time. Generated Rust lives
under Cargo build output, not checked into the repo.

When changing protobuf messages or services:

1. Edit the `.proto` file first.
2. Update API mapping/server code and tests in `crates/control-plane`.
3. Run the relevant `cargo test` command; code generation happens during the
   build.
4. Do not hand-edit generated output under `target/`.

## Required Commands

Use the smallest gate that covers the change, then widen when shared behavior
or cross-component contracts move.

| Change | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| Any Rust change | `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo test` |
| Whitespace/docs | `git diff --check` |
| Proxy-core primitives | `cargo test -p proxy-core` and, for hot paths, `cargo bench -p proxy-core --bench proxy_primitives -- --sample-size 10 --measurement-time 1 --warm-up-time 1` |
| Frontline route/cache/listener | `cargo test -p frontline`; route lookup changes also run `cargo bench -p frontline --bench route_lookup -- --sample-size 10 --measurement-time 1 --warm-up-time 1` |
| Control-plane API/store/lifecycle | `cargo test -p control-plane`; Postgres-backed store work also run `./scripts/test-postgres-store.sh` |
| PostgreSQL execution gate | `python3 scripts/test-postgres-execution.py`; CI and `test-postgres-store.sh` use the same complete-target skip/count checker |
| Sidecar runtime/idle | `cargo test -p sidecar` |
| API/observability crate boundaries | `./scripts/test-dependency-boundaries.py`, `cargo test -p sleepypods-api -p sleepypods-observability -p proxy-core -p frontline -p sidecar` |
| Production images | `./scripts/smoke-images.sh` |
| Load-budget logic | `./scripts/test-load-budget.sh`, `./scripts/test-criterion-regressions.py`, and the relevant `./scripts/smoke-*-load.sh` |
| Benchmark regression review | `./scripts/check-criterion-regressions.py` after collecting local Criterion baselines |
| Kubernetes materializer | `./scripts/test-kind-materializer.sh` |
| Full platform behavior | the targeted `./scripts/test-kind-e2e-*.sh` gate |
| Protocol fixture | `cargo test --locked -p proxy-core --example kind_protocol_app` executes direct HTTP/2, two-proxy-hop and WebSocket fixture regressions |
| Soak inventory reader/polling | `python3 scripts/test-full-wake-sleep-inventory.py` (mocked Kubernetes; no cluster) |
| Repeated wake/sleep leaks | `./scripts/soak-kind-full-wake-sleep.sh` or `./scripts/soak-kind-materializer.sh` |

No cargo tests are required for docs-only changes unless the docs edit also
changes code.

An ordinary workspace run may self-skip optional database wrappers when no
PostgreSQL URL is set. It is not actual store conformance. The separate database
gate requires a complete unfiltered `postgres_store` target, including certificate
store, native API and watch tests, and rejects skips, ignored cases and incomplete
output. Its checker supplements Cargo's exit status; callers must preserve both.

## kind And Smoke Scripts

Targeted gates live in `scripts/`:

- `test-kind-e2e-stateless.sh`: stateless create/wake/hot-route/sleep/delete.
- `test-kind-e2e-stateful.sh`: StatefulSet plus static PV/PVC and data
  continuity.
- `test-kind-e2e-routing.sh`: exact/wildcard HTTP route and HTTP-01 behavior.
- `test-kind-e2e-protocols.sh`: HTTP/2, h2c gRPC-shaped, and WebSockets.
- `test-kind-e2e-tls.sh`: native certificate publication, TLS termination and SNI
  passthrough, plus exact-replica certificate rotation/removal, live protocols,
  lifecycle, outage and restart checks. This explicit release gate includes real
  sleep-floor and five-minute lease waits. Local ignored tests are not deployed
  execution evidence.
- `test-kind-e2e-grpc-web.sh`: deployed browser-shaped gRPC-Web operator path.
- `test-kind-e2e-libpq-sni.sh`: real PostgreSQL/libpq 17 direct SNI
  passthrough.
- `test-kind-e2e-failures.sh`: bad route, readiness failure, PVC binding
  failure, bad volume template, and stale generation.
- `test-kind-e2e-restart.sh`: control-plane restart recovery.
- `test-kind-e2e-lifecycle-races.sh`: concurrent wake/sleep/delete/stale
  lifecycle races.

## Invariants

- The control-plane API is the only public write path for workload classes,
  instances, routes, certificates, TLS hostname bindings, HTTP-01 tokens,
  lifecycle state, and materialization intent. Do not introduce a direct
  user-facing Kubernetes manifest workflow.
- The database is the source of truth. Proxies, sidecars, and users do not write
  it directly.
- Keep provider-specific semantics behind traits such as `ControlPlaneStore`
  and `KubernetesMaterializerClient`.
- `WorkloadClassVersion` is immutable; instances pin a class version.
- Hot proxy paths must avoid control-plane calls, database access, global locks,
  unbounded allocation, and per-request client construction.
- Route cache subscription IDs are opaque. Do not parse them or make them part
  of public resource identity.
- Deployment and StatefulSet automatic sleep require exactly one replica and a current Pod UID; unknown or overlapping membership fails closed.
- HTTP/3, multi-cluster remote forwarding, and rich route predicates are
  deferred.
- Observability metric names and log event fields must match
  `sleepypods-observability/src`; update operator docs when they change.
- Add dependencies through the ecosystem command (`cargo add`, `npm install`,
  etc.) unless there is no suitable command or an exact manual constraint is
  required. Inspect manifest and lockfile diffs afterward.

## Agent Workflow

1. Read `docs/development-plan.md` for the current milestone and any
   `Incomplete` rows before editing.
2. Read the source-of-truth files listed above for the area being changed.
3. Make the smallest complete change. Split files by responsibility only when
   it keeps ownership clear.
4. Run focused tests first, then the release gate that matches the behavior.
5. Update docs and development-plan evidence only after the behavior or docs are
   actually present.
6. Run `git diff --check` before review.
7. Do not commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.
